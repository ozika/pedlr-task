  <h1>
    Study information and consent
  </h1>

  <p>
    Thank you for your interest in participating in our study.
    Please read the following information carefully.
    At the end of this page you will be able to give your informed consent to participate in this study.
  </p>

  <p>
    <br>
  </p>

  <h2>
    1. Aim of the study
  </h2>

  <p>
    In this study we want to learn more about how humans make reward-based decisions.
    To this end, we designed a new task in which you will have to repeatedly make decisions between two different options.
    After each decision you will get a reward that depends on your choice.
    Your goal will be to choose those options which promise the highest reward.
    You are eligible for this study if you are fluent in English, 18-80 years old, and are not currently receiving psychiatric treatment or taking medication for mental illness.
  </p>

  <p>

  </p>

  <h2>
    2. Procedure and content of the study
  </h2>

  <p>
    This experiment will take about 60 minutes, breaks included.
  </p>

  <p>
    After this study information and consent page we will first show you a set of easy questions to make sure you understand the task (about 2 minutes).
    If you answer these questions incorrectly, the experiment will end without payment, so <b>please read the following information carefully</b>.
    If you get these questions right you will then do an easy training exercise.
    We will explain the task in detail as we go along.
    After this training exercise you will move on to the main task.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the main task you will be asked to repeatedly choose between two presented options.
    There are a total of three options, but you will only be shown two at any one time.
    For every option you choose you will get a reward associated with that option in the form of points.
    These points will vary between 0 and 100.
    The reward for one option will not always be the same, but will differ every time you choose it.
    However, <b>one of the two presented options</b> will <b>on average always grant a higher reward</b> than the other option.
    Your task will be to choose the option with the highest reward as often as possible to collect as much reward as possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, you will encounter three different types of questions in this experiment which are explained below:
  </p>

  <h3>
    2.1 Free choices
  </h3>

  <p>
    In these questions you will be shown two options next to each other.
    Both of these options will grant a reward when chosen but you will only receive the reward of the option you chose.
    Your task will be to choose that option which in your opinion will grant the highest reward.
    Please keep in mind that <b>the reward associated with the same option will always be slightly different</b>.
    One of the two options will on average always grant a higher reward than the other option.
    However, you will only get and see the reward of the option you chose.
  </p>

  <h3>
    2.2	Guided choices
  </h3>

  <p>
    In these questions you are also shown two options next to each other, but one of the two options will be highlighted.
    <b>You will have to choose the highlighted option</b> and collect its reward.
    If you fail to choose the highlighted option you will not be rewarded so make sure to choose the highlighted option.
  </p>

  <h3>
    2.3	Estimations
  </h3>

  <p>
    In these questions you will not have to make a choice between two options.
    Instead, you will see only one option in the middle of your screen.
    Your task will be to <b>estimate how much reward you would get</b> on average if you would get to choose that option.
    In these questions you will not get a reward and there are no correct or false answers.
  </p>

  <p>
    As mentioned above, in order to participate you will need to successfully answer a set of easy questions about the instructions.
    Please only participate from a computer (no mobiles, no tablets) and if your screen is at least 13-inch in diagonal.
    <b>Also know that you will need to remain in full screen mode for the entire experiment</b> (the full screen mode will be activated with your consent after this screen).
    If you exit full screen mode, there is no guarantee we can compensate you.

  </h2>

  <p>
    This study is a research project of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Germany.
    The data collected will be used for research purposes only.
    Your Prolific ID will be stored separately from the study data.

    The code list is the only link between your Prolific ID and your study data.
    After payment, the code list will be deleted, and it will no longer be possible to link the study data to your Prolific ID.
    The study data (but not Prolific ID) may be shared with cooperation partners and made publicly accessible via research data bases or scientific publications (typically via the Internet).
    The study data may also be used for new research questions going beyond the purposes of this particular study.
    Study data are only transferred or made publicly accessible without Prolific ID or any data in which persons are identifiable.
